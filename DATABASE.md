# Database Connection Management

## Connection Pool Optimization

This document outlines the strategies implemented to prevent database connection pool timeouts, especially when handling large batches of image uploads.

### Problem

The application was experiencing the following error in production:

```
"Failed to add photos: \nInvalid `prisma.photo.create()` invocation:\n\n\nTimed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool. More info: http://pris.ly/d/connection-pool (Current connection pool timeout: 10, connection limit: 5)"
```

This occurs when too many concurrent database operations exhaust the connection pool, particularly during bulk image uploads.

### Solution

We've implemented several optimizations to prevent connection pool timeouts:

1. **Enhanced Prisma Client Configuration**
   - Increased connection limits for production environments
   - Implemented Prisma Accelerate for better connection management
   - Added proper logging for database errors

2. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
   - Added the `executeWithRetry` utility function
   - Automatically retries operations that fail due to connection issues
   - Uses exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming the database

3. **Single API Call with Internal Batching**
   - Sends all photo URLs in a single API call instead of multiple batches
   - Uses internal batching on the server side for database operations
   - Reduces HTTP overhead while maintaining database efficiency

4. **Optimized Transaction Management**
   - Uses a single transaction for the entire operation
   - Processes images in internal batches within the transaction
   - Uses Promise.all for parallel processing within controlled batch sizes
   - Increased transaction timeouts to accommodate larger operations

5. **Client-Side Optimizations**
   - Simplified client-side code by removing batch processing
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Added better progress indicators

### Production Configuration

For optimal performance in production, ensure these environment variables are set:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
DIRECT_URL=your_direct_database_connection_string (for Prisma Accelerate)
```

### Connection Pool Settings

The application is configured with these connection pool settings:

- **Production**:
  - Connection limit: 10
  - Connection timeout: 15 seconds
  - Transaction timeout: 60 seconds for large operations
  - Using Prisma Accelerate for connection optimization

- **Development**:
  - Connection limit: 5
  - Using cached Prisma client to avoid connection leaks

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. Set up alerts for database connection errors
2. Monitor connection pool utilization
3. Watch for transaction timeouts
4. Set up performance monitoring for API endpoints

### Further Optimization Options

If connection issues persist in production:

1. Consider increasing the database plan to support more connections
2. Implement a queue system for very large operations (1000+ images)
3. Use serverless functions for processing large uploads
4. Consider database sharding for very large datasets
